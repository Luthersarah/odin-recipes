        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The exact origin of macaroni and cheese is unknown, though it most likely hails from Northern Europe, with the earliest known recorded recipe being scribbled down in 1769</p>
        <p>Raffald's recipe is for a Béchamel sauce with cheddar cheese—a Mornay sauce in French cooking—which is mixed with macaroni, sprinkled with Parmesan, and baked until bubbly and golden.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
                <li>¼ cup butter</li>
                <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
                <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 cups milk </li>
                <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour, salt, and pepper until smooth, about 5 minutes. Slowly pour milk into butter-flour mixture while continuously stirring until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Add Cheddar cheese to milk mixture and stir until cheese is melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Fold macaroni into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
            </ol>
