        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Juicy roasted chicken: To start, brine your chicken in a mixture of water and a few tablespoons of salt for about 20 to 30 minutes. This will boost the natural flavor and moisture of the chicken breasts and will leave you with a super tender piece of meat. </p>
        <p>This is the one step that will really ensure your chicken won't be dry or tough.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
                <li>salt and black pepper to taste </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste </li>
                <li>Â½ cup margarine, divided </li>
                <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan, and season generously inside and out with salt and pepper. Sprinkle inside and out with onion powder. Place 3 tablespoons margarine in the chicken cavity. Arrange dollops of the remaining margarine around the chicken's exterior. Cut the celery into 3 or 4 pieces, and place in the chicken cavity.</li>
                <li>Bake uncovered 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven, to a minimum internal temperature of 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove from heat, and baste with melted margarine and drippings. Cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
